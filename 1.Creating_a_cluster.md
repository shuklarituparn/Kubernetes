Kubernetes coordinates a highly available cluster of computers that are connected to work as a single unit. 

Kubernetes automates the distribution and scheduling of application containers across a cluster in a more efficient way

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two types of resources:

    The Control Plane coordinates the cluster
    Nodes are the workers that run applications

The Control Plane is responsible for managing the cluster. The Control Plane coordinates all activities in your cluster, such as scheduling applications, maintaining applications' desired state, scaling applications, and rolling out new updates.

A node is a VM or a physical computer that serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster

Node-level components, such as the kubelet, communicate with the control plane using the Kubernetes API, which the control plane exposes. End users can also use the Kubernetes API directly to interact with the cluster.
