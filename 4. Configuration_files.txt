           Key points to note:

Ensure that there is proper spacing before the field names and values.
Indentation should use spaces (typically two spaces) consistently.
Use colons (:) to separate field names and values.
Lists (like containers and ports) should be indented properly with a - before each list item.
Make sure there are no extra spaces or tabs that could break the YAML structure.

With these corrections, your YAML file should be valid, and you should be able to apply it using kubectl apply -f nginx_config.yaml without encountering any parsing errors.
