2  deployment /PODS

2 Service 

We'll have 2 pods

1st will be the MongoDB and the 2nd will be the MongoExpress 

Then a deployment config file and the config map that contains the DB URL and the  secret that contains the DB username and password

We'll reference both in the deployment

The MongoExpress will be an external service that runs on the browser and it'll forward to the MongoExpress pod which will then forward it to the pod running MongoDB locally
